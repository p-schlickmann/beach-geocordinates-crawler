# How to run my own scraper?

1. You need python installed on your computer  
2. Clone this repository into your machine  
3. Install the required libraries specified in the requirements.txt file
4. Install [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) on your computer    
5. Open your **terminal** (MacOS, Linux) or **cmd** (Windows), navigate to the project folder and run:  
if you are using pipenv: `pipenv run python app.py` 
if not: `python app.py`
6. You will need a .db file specifying at least city and beach for each Beach 

7. You can specify beach, city or state when calling the class Scraper with the keyword arguments "state=", "city=" or "beach="  
  
Keep in mind this scraper gets accurate results only around 85% of the times so you might want to check your results later, search for meaningless beach names or crazy 
coordinates    


# Why I used Pytesseract and Pillow for this scraper?

Google searches are protected, it's impossible to build a normal scraper for this, after one or two results it will throw StaleElementReferenceError and you can not fix that, beacause itÂ´s a protective measure taken by google to protect their info from being scraped. So I used Selenium printscreen, I cut the image with Pillow and read the image information with Pytesseract
